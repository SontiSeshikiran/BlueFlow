# RouteFluxMap - URL Redirects
# ==============================
# Configure URL routing for Cloudflare Pages.
# See: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/redirects/
#
# Format: [source] [destination] [status]
#   200 = proxy/rewrite (invisible to user)
#   301 = permanent redirect
#   302 = temporary redirect
#
# NOTE: These redirects are processed BEFORE the static files.
# If you want to serve static files normally, DON'T add redirects for them.

# === EXAMPLES (uncomment as needed) ===

# Proxy /data/* to external data bucket (if ENABLE_DATA_PROXY=true in config)
# This lets you serve data from same domain without CORS issues
# /data/* https://your-data-url/:splat 200

# Redirect old URLs to new ones
# /old-page /new-page 301

# SPA fallback (for client-side routing - NOT needed for Astro static)
# /* /index.html 200
